## Personal Portfolio

Convert the previous simple HTML website into a personal portfolio.

The goal of this project is to teach you how to style a website using CSS. You will take the structure from the previous HTML-only project and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

### Project Overview

In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously. The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website.

Rough mockups of the website structure for mobile and desktop devices are provided below. At this stage, do not worry about design details such as colors and backgrounds. The aim is to ensure a well-structured and responsive website that aligns with the mockups and looks good on different screen sizes.

- **Styled HTML Website**

### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include:

- A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.
- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
- Proper use of CSS techniques such as Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
- A responsive navigation bar and a well-styled contact form.

### Bonus Points

For bonus points, you can:

- Use Google Fonts to enhance the typography of your website.
- Explore GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages to host your website for free.
- Add support for dark mode using CSS variables.

### Outcome

After completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to style a basic HTML website using CSS. You can then proceed to more advanced topics, such as CSS animations, transitions, and grid layouts, in future projects.
